T Starter is a little tool for T2002 to handle level packs.

What to do
----------
Get T2002X from pekaro.de, unzip it,
then put everything included in your T Starter archive in the T2002X-directory.
If your T2002X-directory does not reside in a user directory
you have to run T Starter with administrative rights.

When the T Starter is started the first time, it creates a "Bonus"-directory.
You can put your level-packs in there or you can instruct the T Starter to download them.
T Starter uses the Turrican Levelbase (http://turricanforever.de/levelbase) to do that.
Please do not rename your level-packs, or the T Starter will not be able
to recognize which level-packs you already have.

Troubleshooting
---------------
All file operations are logged in the TStarter.log.
Additionally T Starter creates a ts30rescue.dat file.
T Starter will use this file to repair your T2002 directory structure
if you turn your computer off while playing T2002.
