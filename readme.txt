T Starter is a little tool for T2002 to handle level packs.

What to do
----------
First install T2002 and the T2002-level-editor.
Then put everything included in your T Starter archive in the T2002-directory.
If you are running Vista, you are ready to go. If your T2002-directory does not reside
in a user directory you have to run T Starter with administrative rights.
On earlier versions of Windows you need either the .Net Framework (version 2.0)
or the special MiniMono T Starter pack.
You can download the .Net Framework at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5
If you use MiniMono, use T Starter.bat to start the T Starter, else just use T Starter.exe directly.
Please note that MinoMono T Starter has a known problem
in the download manager (the file list likes to disappear).

When the T Starter is started the first time, it creates a "Bonus"-directory.
You can put your level-packs in there or you can instruct the T Starter to download them.
T Starter uses T.R.Schmidt's fabulous Turrican SETA-page
(http://turrican.nemmelheim.de -> http://www.nemmelheim.de/turrican/t2002/) to do that.
If you downloaded a T Starter, which includes 7-Zip or a recent version of 7-Zip or WinRAR is installed,
T Starter will unpack your level-packs, otherwise you have to do this yourself
(in a new directory named like the archive in the Bonus-directory).
Please do not rename your level-packs, or the T Starter will not be able
to recognize which level-packs you already have.

Troubleshooting
---------------
All file operations are logged in the TStarter.log.
Additionally T Starter creates a ts25rescue.dat file.
T Starter will use this file to repair your T2002 directory structure
if you turn your computer off while playing T2002.
